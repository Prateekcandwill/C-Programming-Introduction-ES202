- Predefined processors and command line arguments.

### Module IV: Arrays and Functions
- One-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.
- Iterative programs using arrays.
- Concept of sub-programming and user-defined functions.
- Function prototypes, return values, and recursion.

### Module V: Advanced Features in C
- Pointers and their relationship with arrays.
- Argument passing using pointers and passing arrays as arguments.
- Strings and the C string library.
- Structures and unions: defining structures, nested structures, and file handling.

## Lab/Practicals Syllabus:

For practical labs in C programming, students will use the TURBO C IDE. Students can create their own projects or utilize datasets from online repositories.

1. Introduction to TURBO C IDE and programming environment.
2. Basic operations with variables and data types in C.
3. Implement decision-making structures: if, if-else, and switch-case.
4. Create and use loops: for, while, and do-while.
5. Implement functions: user-defined functions, function prototypes, and recursion.
6. Work with one-dimensional arrays: create, manipulate, and iterate through arrays.
7. Work with two-dimensional arrays: matrix computations and operations.
8. Implement structures and unions: defining and using structures in C.
9. Use pointers: pointer arithmetic, passing pointers to functions, and arrays of pointers.
10. Implement file handling: reading from and writing to files in C.
11. Create a simple project: develop a console-based application using C.
12. Debugging and error handling in C programs.
13. Implement a program that utilizes command line arguments.
14. Explore memory management: dynamic memory allocation using malloc and free.
15. Create a project that combines multiple concepts learned throughout the course.
